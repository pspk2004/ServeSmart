# ServeSmart - A Modern College Mess Management System

ServeSmart is a complete, end-to-end mess management system built for colleges and hostels. It provides a seamless digital experience for both students and mess administrators, handling everything from meal registration and real-time QR code verification to point tracking and user management.

This project is built with a robust Python Flask backend, a dynamic HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend, and a scalable NoSQL database (MongoDB). It is designed for easy deployment on modern cloud platforms.

## üöÄ Core Features

### üéì For Students
- **Simple Registration & Login**: Secure authentication using college roll numbers.
- **Point-Based System**: Students start with a point balance that is used for meal registrations.
- **One-Click Meal Registration**: Register for any meal with a single button click from the weekly menu.
- **Active Token Display**: A dedicated section on the dashboard prominently displays all unused QR codes for the current day.
- **Meal & Point History**: Track a complete history of all registered meals and their status (Used/Not Used).

### üßë‚Äçüíº For Administrators
- **Secure Admin Login**: A separate, secure login for mess administrators (`admin` / `adminpass`).

- **Manual Verification Backup**: An option to manually type in a token ID if the scanner fails.
- **Daily Registration Overview**: A dashboard that lists all students who have registered for meals on the current day and their token status.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python with the Flask web framework.
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript with Bootstrap 5.
- **Database**: MongoDB (cloud-hosted via MongoDB Atlas).
- **QR Code Generation**: `qrcode` Python library.
- **QR Code Scanning**: `html5-qrcode` JavaScript library.
- **Deployment Target**: Vercel

```

#### Install Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Create `.env` file
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and paste the following:

```env
MONGO_URI="your-mongodb-uri-here"
SECRET_KEY="your-random-secret-key"
```

### Step 3: Run the App

```bash
python app.py
